            <h5 class="introduction">
                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Bodhgaya</strong> called Uruvela until renamed, is the cradle of
                Budhism. The earliest inhabitants of Uruvela were Neolithic people living in village Taradih living some
                4500 years ago. A land of mango and <em>Jamun</em> groves, here in the 6th century BC, the prince
                Siddhartha Gautam of Kapilvastu attained supreme enlightenment underneath a Peepal tree, to be called
                Bodhi tree later, and came to be called as Tathagat Buddha. <br />
                Within two centuries of the Buddha’s enlightenment, the name Uruvela fell into disuse and was replaced
                by four other names: Sambodhi (complete enlightenment), Bodhimanda (area around which Buddha attained
                enlightenment), Vajrasana (the diamond throne), and Mahabodhi (great enlightenment). </p>
                <p>In the 3rd century BC, the Emperor Asoka visited Bodhgaya and had the Vajrasana constructed with
                    Baluva stones. Around 2nd century BC, the Sunga rulers laid railing around the Bodhi tree. A
                    monastery and Sujatastupa were also built around this time. In the 5th century BC, a magnificent
                    Mahabodhi Temple was constructed here.
                </p>
                <p>A monastery was built by the king Meghavarman of Sri Lanka for his monks. The front pavallion was
                    added to the temple by king Sado. In the 7th century AD, the King Sasanka of Gauda destroyed the
                    Bodhi tree and it was replanted by the King Purnavarnam and he erected stone railings around the
                    temple. Hieun Tsang also came to Bodhgaya for pilgrimage. The King of Myanmar (Burma) carried out
                    the repair works to the temple.<br />
                    The glory of Bodhgaya began to fade after the 12th century AD gradually and the Holy land went into
                    oblivion by the end of the 16th century AD. A recluse named GossainGhamadGiri established a
                    SaiviteMatha in the secluded place that it had become, but no attention was paid to arrest the decay
                    of the temple. As a result, the temple fell apart in the 19th century AD.
                </p>
                <p>The King of Mayamar (Burma) once again tried to conserve the temple but could not persist for long.
                    Finally, in 1880, a massive conservation exercise was undertaken by Sir Alexander Cunningham.<br />
                    This was followed by a struggle for possession of the Mahabodhi Temple between the Mahanta of
                    Bodhgaya and Buddhists under AnagarikaDharmapala. Eventually, in 1949 the Bodhgaya Temple Act was
                    passed and in 1953 the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) was set up. BTMC is managing the
                    Bodhgaya Mahabodhi Temple since then.

                    <p>The Mahabodhi Temple, Bodhgaya is located 115 kilometers south of the state capital of Bihar,
                        Patna and 16 kilometers from the district headquarters at Gaya in the eastern India. It is one
                        of the four holy sites associated with the life of Lord Buddha, particularly to his attainment
                        of Enlightenment. The temple complex has a total area of 4.8600 ha and its height is 50 meters.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Mahabodhi Temple was the first temple built by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century BC when he
                        erected the Vajrasan, but its present form dates back to the 5th century BC. Today, the complex
                        comprise of the grand temple, the sacred Bodhi Tree, the Vajrasana and other 6 sacred sites,
                        surrounded by numerous ancient Votive stupas, and demarcated by a well maintained network of
                        inner, middle and outer boundaries and three levels of inner pathways. The seventh sacred site,
                        the MuchlindSarovar, is located outside the enclosure to the south.The main entrance to the
                        Temple complex is from the east, but it does have gates in the west, south and the north too.
                        <br />
                        The main temple wall has an average height of 11 meters and it is built in the classical style
                        of Indian temple architecture. It has entrances from the east, a live entrance in the north for
                        its first floor, and a low basement with mouldings decorated with honey suckle and geese design.
                        Above this lies a series of niches containing mini images of the Buddha.Further above, there are
                        mouldings and chaityas niches, and then the curvilinear shikhara or tower of the temple
                        surmounted by the amalaka and kalash.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the four corners of the parapet of the temple are the four statues of Buddha in small shrine
                        chambers. A small tower is built over each of the shrines. The temple faces east and has small
                        forecourt on either side containing statues of the Buddha. A doorway leads into a small hall,
                        beyond which lies the sanctum, containing a 5 feet high statue of seated Buddha hold earth as
                        witness to his achieved Enlightenment. Above the sanctum is a small hall with a shrine
                        containing a statue of Buddha, where senior months gather to meditate.

                    <p>After years of such self-torture at Dungeshwari Hills, Siddhhartha was completely worn out.
                        Siddhartha’s prolonged austerities proved utterly futile. The more he tormented himself, the
                        farther his goal receded from him. He got increasingly convinced that such a path actually
                        weakened his intellect and diminished his spirit, thereby distracting him from his goal. He
                        conceived the idea of adopting a ‘middle path’, which was to later become the cornerstone of his
                        teaching. Deciding to nourish his body sparingly, Siddhartha bathed in the river and accepted a
                        bowl of rice-milk (Kheer) from the hand of Sujata, a young woman who lived in the neighbouring
                        village, who thought that he is a tree deity. Siddhartha’s lips quivered and his mouth and
                        throat moistened from the nourishing sweet dish.
                    </p>
                    <p>The five companions who lived with Siddhartha for six years during his ascetic practices - were
                        disappointed to observe Siddhartha receiving food from the hands of a woman. Disgusted to see
                        Siddhartha’s perceived deviation from struggle and the prescribed norm of the time, they all
                        left thinking that he has reverted to a life of luxury.
                    </p>
                    <p>Siddhartha, bent on attaining his goal, sat down at the foot of the majestic tree and vowed to
                        himself, “Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve,
                        but I will not move from this seat until I attain enlightenment.” Gently closing his eyes, in
                        <em>Vajraasana</em> he turned his awareness inwards.

                    <p>Seeing them leave him so easily, Siddhartha felt sorry for their lack of confidence but he did
                        not worry being alone. He walked along the clear-flowing Niranjanariver and placed his bowl on
                        it, solemnly declaring, “If this bowl floats upstream, I’ll become enlightened. The bowl indeed
                        floated upstream. The bowl sailed diagonally across the river – and reached the other bank near
                        the base of aawe-evoking peepal tree that would soon shelter his monumental accomplishment.

                    <p>The most important of the sacred places in the Mahabodhi Temple complex in Bodhgaya is the giant
                        Bodhi Tree. Located on the west of the temple currently, the tree was supposed to be the direct
                        descendant of the original Bodhi Tree in Uruvela forest tract, under which Buddha spent his
                        first week and had his enlightenment at the age of 35 in the year 531 BC.
                    </p>
                    <p>Legends have it that the younger queen of Emperor Asoka, Tisrarsita got jealous of the Bodhi Tree
                        and the mud Vajrasan platform in view of the Emperor Asoka’s increasing engagement to the tree
                        and the site during his <em>DhammaYatraKram</em> in the 3rd century. Consequently, she attempted
                        to get them destroyed post Emperor Asoka’s visit. But soon enough the tree sprouted.The Emperor
                        Asoka then got the permanent Vajrasana of polished sandstone constructed with Baluva stones
                        adjoining the west wall of Mahabodhi Temple for ensuring its longevity and to permanently mark
                        the spot where Buddha sat and meditated. The Vajrasan is believed to be the seat where Buddha
                        sat and attained his enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree. The slab bears gold gild all around its
                        surface and is now covered with religious cloth and golden canopy.
