            <h5 class="introduction">
                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Nalanda</strong> has a heritage as an international centre of
                education for more than 700 years. It was also a prosperous place of spiritual importance during the
                days of the Buddha. While staying in Nalanda’s vicinity, the Buddha usually resided in Amballathika or
                at Pavarika’s Mango Grove. XuanZang informs that King sakraditya (5th century CE) established the
                NalandaMahavira at the site of Pavarika’s Mango Grove. According to the Jataka tales in one of his
                former lives, the Buddha was a generous king who had a capital here, and thus the name ‘Nalanda’, which
                means ‘insatiable in giving.’</p>
                <p>Sometime after the death of the Buddha, a major famine broke out and Nalanda’s prosperity waned. The
                    King Asoka visited the sacred town again in the 3rd century BCE and it flourished again. It reached
                    its peak between the Gupta and Pala periods (4th to 7 centuries) with the establishment of
                    theNalandaMahavihara. Nalanda was the place of birth and nirvana of the famous disciple of the
                    Buddha, Sariputra. It became famous for its religious, philosophical, linguistic, social, and
                    scientific fields of study. It was founded by Kumaragupta (413-455 AD) of the Gupta dynasty, King
                    Harshvardhan of Kannauj (606-647 AD), and Pala kings of est India (8-12 century AD). The decline of
                    the great institutions started in late Pala period but the final blow came in around 1200 AD by the
                    invasion of BakhtiarKilji.</p>
                <p>The galaxy of luminaries associated with it includes Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Vasubandhu, Dharampala,
                    Suvishnu, Asanga, Shilbhadra, Dharmakriti, Shantarakshita and celebrated Chinese traveller
                    XuanZiang. Various subjects like Theology, Grammer, Logic, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Medicine, and
                    Philosophy were taught here. The institution was maintained by the revenue collected from the
                    villages bestowed specifically for the purpose by the contemporary rulers. More than 8000 students
                    from all over Asia attended the university, the teachers numbered over 1000. Admissions were
                    strictly scruitinised and were rejected by the gatekeeper, who would pose questions requiring quick
                    and accurate answers.</p>
                <p>Today, the 35 acre archaeological park contains a row of temple and monastery ruins. According to
                    XuanZang, the temple ruin actually marks the location of the ‘fragrant’ hut that the Buddha occupied
                    while staying at the Pavarika’s Mango Grove. Over the centuries, the buiding transformed from a
                    simple hut to a moderate stupa and then to a great temple. The surrounding votive stupas indicate
                    that this site was the most sacred at Nalanda, and UNESCO has declared the monument as a World
                    Heritage Site.</p>

                    <p>Set up as a tribute to one of the greatest Buddhist scholars and travellers of the time, XuanZang
                        travelled overland to India from China, through Taklamakan Desert and Himalayan mountains, in
                        the seventh century without a map. The tremendous hardship he endured were rewarded by the 15
                        years of joy he enjoyed as a pilgrim in India. In his epic journal, he left behind a fascinating
                        account of Indian culture, history, and society that he observed during his visits to the sacred
                        sites, and while teaching and learning at Nalanda.</p>
                    <p>On his journey homewards, the legendary pilgrim carried with him 657 Buddhist texts, which later
                        he translated into Chinese. These works helped clarify many of the misunderstandings of the
                        Dhamma by ealy Chinese scholars, and also helped later researchers to discover many of the lost
                        sacred sites connected to the Buddha’s life.</p>

                    <p>Legend has it that when a man woke up one early morning, he noticed a poisonous snake slither
                        over his wife’s arm, and the curled out of the room. He woke her wife, told her about what
                        happened and about the transitory nature of life. With his wife’s approval he saved his head,
                        sewed a robe from a discarded rags and set out as homeless wanderer in serch of a teacher and
                        meaning of life. Then while resting at Nalanda, the man saw the Buddha approach and offered him
                        his robe to sit on. The Buddha accepted it with smile and then offered his robe in return.
                        Receiving Dhamma instruction from Buddha, the traveller realized the experience of an arahant.
                        This man was the legendary Mahakasssapa. He went off to live in the wild and was soon recognized
                        as the master of aesthetic practices and the Buddha’s fourth ranking disciple (after Kondanna,
                        Sariputta, and Mogallana). For many Buddhist traditions, the famous exchange of robes symbolizes
                        the transmission of the lineage of Teachers.</p>
