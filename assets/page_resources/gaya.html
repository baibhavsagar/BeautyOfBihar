                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Gaya</strong> A city of ancient historical and mythological
                significance,
                Gaya is one of the main tourist attractions in Bihar and the second largest city in the state.
                It is 100 km from Patna, the capital of Bihar and one of the major pilgrimage sites for Hindus and
                Buddhists.
                Its natural surroundings, narrow by lanes and its age old buildings make it special..
            </h5>
            <h5>Gaya derives its name from Gayasur, a mythological demon. Legends say that Gaya served rigid penance and
                secured blessings from Lord Vishnu,
                after which his body transformed into the rocky hills, which now form the landscape of Gaya.
                People following Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism form the major population of Gaya.
                Hindus consider Gaya to be the place for attaining salvation. Hence, they perform pindadaan (funeral
                offerings of the deceased) here.
                Gaya is an important site for Jains as it is home to numerous Jain temples.
                Gaya is important for Buddhists as Buddha preached the Fire Sermon at Brahmayoni Hill, which was earlier
                called Gayasisa.

                    Mahakala cave in the Mahabodhi mountain,
                    where he practiced extreme austerities such as: clenching his teeth while pressing his tongue
                    against the roof of the mouth,
                    holding his breath; fasting or taking minimal food; eating cow or human dung, or only wild fruits;

                <p>After setting in motion the wheel of Dhamma in Sarnath, the Buddha returned to Gaya and taught the
                    Dhamma to the eminent Kassapa brothers – Uruvela, Nadi, and Gaya – and their one thousand disciples.
                    UruvelaKassapa, a matted-haired fire worshipper, was considered to be one of the foremost spiritual
                    authorities at the time. Knowing the medicant’s mind, the Buddha skillfully performed a seies of
                    super-normal feats such as reading UruvelaKassapa’s mind, splitting five hundred logs in an instant,
                    remaining unharmed during a great flood, and taming a fierce <em>naga. </em>
                </p>
                <p>Impressed with the Bddha’s words and deeds, the entire group of matted haired fire worshippers shaved
                    their heads and joined the Buddha’s community as<em>bhikkus. </em>A few days later, the Buddha
                    summoned the<em>bhikkus</em>to the plateau of Gayasisa Mountain, where he delivered his third
                    teaching, the Fire Sermon:
                </p>
                <p><em>Bhikkus, all things are on fire. What is on fire? The six sense organs – eyes, ears, nose,
                        tongue, body and mind – are all on fire. The six sense objects – sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
                        sensations and mental objects – are all on fire. The six consciousnesses – sight, hearing,
                        smell, taste, feeling, and thought are all on fire. The six contact between the sense organs and
                        the sense objects are all on fire. All these sensual experiences are on fire, whether pleasant,
                        unpleasant or neutral. They are burning from the flames of craving, aversion, and ignorance.
                        They are burning from the flames of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and from flames of
                        sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p><em>Bhikkus, when the noble followers understand the truth, they grow disenchanted with six sense
                        organs, six sense objects, six consciousness, six contacts, and six sensual experiences.</em>
                    <em>When they grow disenchanted, craving fades away. With the fading of craving, they are liberated.
                        When liberated, there is knowledge they are liberated. They understand : “Birth is exhausted,
                        the holy life has been lived, what was to be done is done, there is no more of this to
                        come..”</em>
                </p>
                <p>After training Kassapa brothers and their one thousand followers, the Buddha left Gaya never to
                    return, having seen that the inhabitants there clung tightly to their rituals and religious rites,
                    making it very difficult for them to understand his message.

                <h6>Devadutta’s Episode In Brahmajoni Hill.</h6>
                <p>After creating a schism in the Sangha during the last years of the Buddha’s life, his cousin
                    Devadutta brought his five-hundred followers to Gayasisa. Out of the compassion for the misguided
                    monk, the Buddha sent Sariputta and Moggallana to Gayasisa to set them right. When Devadutta saw the
                    chief disciples coming, he thought they are coming to join him. Devadutta joined his palms together
                    and asked Sariputta to give a discourse to the monks, as he was tired after eating a large meal.
                </p>
                <p>While Devadutta’s eyes grew heavy and he fell into a deep sleep, Sariputta gave a profound discourse
                    on the four noble truths. The group of bhikkus listed spellbound by the elder’s words, and all of
                    them, except for a few of Devadutta’s loyal followers, became sotapannas.
                </p>
                <p>When the discouse was over, the group followed the two elders back to the true Master.opening his
                    eyes, Devadutta suddenly realized what had happened. He instantly fell ill and blood gushed out of
                    his mouth.

                    Mahakassapa’s path was blocked by big boulders. The stern monk struck them with his staff and the
                    rock opened up to let him pass. The bhikku then climbed up to the summit, found a nice cave for
                    meditating, and entered into a deep trance.

                    Buddha by MakkhaliGosala. These offerings demonstrate Asoka’s tolerance and support of spiritual
