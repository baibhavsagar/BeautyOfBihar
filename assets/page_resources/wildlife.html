                concentrated in its natural treasure-houses in form of its protected area. The protected area network in
                Bihar covers an area of 3368.4 sq. km, which included one national park and 12 wildlife sanctuaries. The
                habitats of the wildlife are concentrated in the Northern and Southern fringes of the state boundaries,
                neighboring Nepal on the North and Jharkhand in the South. Some historical references of the past and
                associations from ancient days to recent past are noteworthy. “In Patliputra (present Patna) emperor
                Ashok had adopted the
            </h5>
            <h5> Lion for his royal emblem confirming that the home range of Lions were up to Bihar. The Raja of Gidhaur
                had shot white tiger in Lacchuar Forests near Jamui four decades back. The Black Buck of Kaimur and
                Bhojpur, the Blue Bull (Neelgai) in Buxar Diara and Golden Orioles in Purnea has been abundant in recent
                past and some places still sustain their populations. It is difficult to believe that the Katihar
                sub-division was a sportsman’s paradise where Tigers were quite common. The Bettiah forest had local
                Rhinocerous population. The tract of Purnea were inhabited by wild Buffaloes. The Pink headed Duck i.e
                Gulabsir now extinct was founded in Darbhanga as recent as 1935. The Asian Cheetah once roamed the
                tracts of Bihar.

            <p>Valmikinagar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary and Valmiki Tiger Reserve (the only Tiger Reserve in
                Bihar) are located nearly 100 kms from Bettiah in the northern most part of the West Champaran district,
                bordering Nepal. The extensive forest area of Valmikinagar was previously owned by the&nbsp;<a

                small town with scattered inhabitation, mostly within the forest area and a railroad station in the
                district of West Champaran close to the railhead of Narkatiyaganj.
            </p>
            <p>The Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) and Valmiki Wildlife Sanctuary forest area covers 899.38 square
                kilometres which is 17.4% of the total geographical area of the district West Champaran. As of 2013,
                there were 22 tigers in the Reserve. It is the 18th Tiger Reserve of the country and ranked fourth in
                density of Tiger population. In the north, the protected areas are bordered by Nepal while the Indian
                state Uttar Pradesh bounds the sanctuary from western side. Bihar Government is turning 800 hectares of
                forest in VTR into Grassland making it India's biggest grassland.
            </p>
            <p>The main fauna of Valmiki Tiger Reserve consists of Tiger, Leopard, Fishing Cat, Chital, Sambar, Hog
                Deer, Black Buck, Gaur, Sloth Bear, Langur and Rhesus Monkey, while the flora consists of Sal (Shorea
                robusta), Asan, Karama, Semal, Khair, Cane (Calamus tenuis), Jamun, Siccharrum, and Teak etc.<strong>
                </strong>The Reserve has rich avifaunal diversity. Over 250 species of birds have been reported.<strong>
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Adjacent to the sanctuary in the forest in Chitwan National Park of Nepal, lies the historic Valmiki
                Ashram surrounded with temples. The place has the major religious and historical attraction of the
                Valmiki Ashram. Although it is located in the deep forest of Chitwan National Park in Nepal, but one has
                to travel through the forests of Valmikinagar for 7 kilometers to reach the Ashram, and that is through
                India. Even the Nepalese have to travel through Valmikinagar, in India to reach the
                Ashram.<strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>Rishi Valmiki had written the great epic, “Ramayana”, here. Various points of interest around the ashram
                are: Birthplace of Luv &amp; Kush (the two sons of Lord Ram and his divine wife- Sita); Sita’s ‘Falahar’
                eating place; Meditation place of the great Sage-Valmiki; the place where the Ashwamedh horse was tied;
                Amrit Kuan; Vishnu Chakra; Gagristhan and the Hawan Kund.<strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>Various temples, located in the periphery of 3 - 4 kms around the Valmiki Ashram, are the Jatashankar
                Temple, Nardevi Temple and Kaleshwar Temple, surrounded by green forest in the backdrop of the Himalayan
                Mountains. Triveni Temple is located across the Gandak barrage in the Nepal territory at a motorable
                distance of 2-3 kms from Gandak barrage.<strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>The overall climate of Valmikinagar is pleasant. The summer is from March to June, while the Rainy season
                is July to September. The pleasant winter months are November to February. The temperature in
                Valmikinagar is Minimum 8° C and Maximum 36° C. <strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>With Valmikinagar as base, a tourist can find expression to his nomadic instincts by visiting a number of
                places, the grandeur and beauty of which are bound to make one experience the heights of
                ecstasy.<strong></strong><br />
                Archaeologically rich places in and around Valmikinagar are Lauriya Nandan Garh and Someshwar Fort.
                There is a lion pillar of Ashoka at Lauriya Nandan Garh, which is a single block of polished sand stone.
                The pillar is 32’- 9.5” in height with a diameter of 35.5” at the base and 26.2” at the top. The pillar
                though being over 2000 years old is still in excellent condition.<strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>Nandan Garh is a huge mound composed of bricks and is about 80 feet high. According to the authoritative
                source, it is an Ashoka Stupa, in which ashes of Lord Buddha’s funeral pyre are
                enshrined.<strong></strong><br />
                Someshwar Fort is situated in Narkatiyaganj sub-division, near Nepal border, on top of Someshwar Hill at
                2884 ft. above M.S.L. It is in a ruined state but its remains are well defined.
            </p>
            <p>Close to Valmikinagar is Triveni, which is a holy place for Hindus. The name is derived from the fact
                that three river, namely – Naraini, Sohna and Pachnad - merge here, to form Gandak, soon after they
                emerge from the hills. Triveni is also believed to be the site at which the fight commenced between the
                Lords of Forest and Water (Gaj and Grah or the Elephant and the Crocodile).

            681.99 sq. kms on the hills and undulating tract of Kharagpur Hills. It is situated at a distance of 56 kms
            from Munger, 20 kms from Jamui Railway Station and 200 kms from Patna Airport.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p>This forest are located in the famous Kharagpur hill range, south of river Ganga and is surrounded on all
                sides by non-forestry areas inhabited by dense population. The vegetation of these forests is very rich
                where Sal, Kend, Semal and other trees grow side by side the hilly terrain, protecting from the suns
                rays the forms and humble creepers which grow below.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>A host of animals such as Tiger, Leopards, Sloth Bear, Nilgai, Sambhar, Barking Deer, Wild Beer, four
                horned Antelope use to abide by in these forests. In the valley portions and at the foothills, are
                several hot springs, of which the finest are at Bhimbandh, Sita Kund and Rishi Kund. All the hot springs
                maintain nearly same temperature round the year, and seasonal fluctuation of discharge is also nominal.
                Among them the Bhimbandh groups of springs have the maximum temperature (52° C to 65°C) and discharge
                (0.84-1.12 cum/sec) and constitute the best area for the exploration of geothermal energy potential.
            </p>
            <p>All the thermal springs of sanctuary have a common geological frame. The spouts issue from the contact of
                massive guartzites (jointed and crushed) with states and phyllites (Kharagpur Group).&nbsp; <br />
                All the springs are situated at topographic lows within the guartziter. The aqueducts formed due to
                fracturing are long and narrow zones of fissures and broken rocks.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>There are number of places of tourist interest nearby the Sanctuary like Rishikund, Ha-Ha Punch Kumari,

            <p><strong>Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary</strong>&nbsp;is a 50 kilometers stretch of area situated
                on the river Ganga. The sanctuary is located in the district of Bhagalpur in the state of
                Bihar.&nbsp;<em>Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary</em>&nbsp;was initiated as a protected area for
                the conservation of River Dolphins by the government of India in the year 1991. The species of dolphins
                found in the sanctuary were classified as endangered in the year 2006 by IUCN and intense measures have
                been taken to ensure their survival and re-population ever since. The span
                of&nbsp;<strong><em>Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary</em></strong>&nbsp;extends from Kahalgaon in
                east Bhagalpur to Sultanganj in the west, harboring within it a multitude of aquatic species. The
                Gangetic Dolphin holds immense significance for India as it is the national aquatic animal of the
                country and also one of the four species of river dolphins. However, in the past century, the population
                of these aquatic angels has seen an unsettling decline due to various human-made factors including
                motorized boats and fishing. The sanctuary serves as a useful resource for the study of these
                magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.
            </p>
            <p>Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary experiences warm weather during the summers. The mercury
                fluctuates around an average of&nbsp;<strong>32 degree Celsius during the month of May</strong>, which
                is the hottest month. Winters are slightly cooler and are comfortable. Average temperature during the
                coldest month of January is around 17 degree Centigrade. The rains in July bring change in the weather
                and also a rise in water level with an average of 249 millimeters of rainfall.
            </p>
            <p>The sanctuary remains open throughout the year but the best time to visit is between June and October.
                Most number of dolphins can be spotted at this time along with numerous birds and marine life.<br />
                <em>Wildlife at Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary</em>

            <p>There are various aquatic species of flora and fauna found in Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary.
                Besides Dolphins, other species include Gharial, Indian Smooth Coated Otter and Turtles. One can also
                spot migratory and residential birds in the area. Inside the river, several species of fresh water
                shrimps, fish and crustaceans can be observed.

                nearby town, as well as 'Bodh Gaya', another neighbouring town which are both connected to Lord Buddha
                and His divine enlightenment. Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary is spread across an area measuring about
                259 square kilometres, half of its area extending over a plateau belonging to the area of Chota Nagpur
                and another portion of it extending over the fertile Gangetic plains. This part of the country is
                abounding with numerous ecosystems which co-exist, thereby giving rise to a great amount of biodiversity
                here. The density of the forest regions differs and so does the type of forests, as per the location.

            <p><strong>History of Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary</strong>
                Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary is amongst the most ancient wildlife reserves in the northern part of
                the country. The sanctuary was privately owned during the British Raj and even post Indian independence,
                till the year 1950 and it served as a popular Game Reserve which was often passed between the royal
                hands, British Empire in India and later, the Indians. Eventually, the place was proclaimed an official
                wildlife sanctuary during the year 1976 by the Government of Bihar, who later named it as the Gautam
                Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary.
            <p>
            <p><strong>Fauna of Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary</strong><br />
                Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary boasts of a varied species of fauna which is inclusive of mammals and
                birds. Tiger, Blue Bull, Wild Buffalo, Spotted Deer, Barking Deer, Wild Dog and Leopard are some of the
                wild creatures which dwell inside this sanctuary. This region is also filled with plenty of birds or
                avifauna consisting of Pea Fowl, Water Fowl and many others.
            </p>
            <p>The Divisional Forest Office, Gaya administers the Gautama Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary and therefore the
                sanctuary can only be approached if visitors are armed with the prior permission for paying visit to
                this region. The Range Officer supervises all the visits to this sanctuary and if special arrangements
                are required in the sanctuary, they are organised by this officer. The perfect time to access the
                sanctuary is during the winter, particularly in the period between the months of November and March,
                when one can easily avert the rains and scorching heat of the summer.
