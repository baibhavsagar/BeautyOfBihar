                    languages, Bihar has also produced writers in English such as Raj Kamal Jha, Amitava Kumar, Tabish
                    Khair, Abhay K, Siddhartha Chowdhury;[1] and Hindi including Raja Radhika Raman Prasad Sinha, Kumar
                    vansi, Acharya Ramlochan Saran, Acharya Shivpujan Sahay, Divakar Prasad Vidyarthy, Ramdhari Singh
                    'Dinkar', Ram Briksh Benipuri, Phanishwar Nath 'Renu', Gopal Singh "Nepali", Ramesh Chandra Jha and
                    Baba Nagarjun. Writer and Buddhist scholar Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan was born in Uttar Pradesh
                    but spent his life in the land of Buddha, i.e., Bihar. Hrishikesh Sulabh is a short story writer,
                    playwright and theatre critic. Arun Kamal and Aalok Dhanwa are poets.</p>
                <p> In India there are 22 scheduled languages, 114 other languages, 216 mother tongues, 96 non specified
                    languages and totally up to 10000 languages spoken by the people in different region and part of
                    India.
                    In Bihar major language is Hindi that spoken by 80.9% of population and other are Urdu and Santali.
                </p>
                <p>Classification of Indian languages have evolved from different stocks and are closely connected with
                    the different ethnic
                    groups/ people of India.
                    Broadly the Indian languages can be put into six groups:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Indo-Aryan</li>
                    <li>Dravidian</li>
                    <li>Sino-Tibetan</li>
                    <li>Negroid</li>
                    <li>Austric</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These languages have interacted on one another through the centuries and have produced the major
                    linguistic divisions of modern India. The Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian are the dominant groups and
                    together comprises all the major languages of India. Bihari language belong to first one.
                    Indo-Aryan:
                </p>
                <h5>Linguistic Identities in Bihar</h5>
                <p>On the basis of language-cum-culture, the present day Bihar can be divided into four distinct
                    categories
                    of subregional identities – Maithili, Bhojpuri, Magadhi and the tribal language(s) of the Jharkhand
                    region.
                    Grierson has described the language of Bihar as Bihari, 4 which in his scheme of classification
                    belongs
                    to the Eastern group of Hindi, covering an area of 90,000 square miles and is spoken by the
                    36,000,000
                    people from the Himalayas on the north to Singhbhum on the South, and from Manbhum on the South-east
                    to
                    Basti on the north-west.
                </p>
                <h5>Magadhi</h5>
                <p>The word ‘Maghi’ is a deviant of sanskrit word Magadhi. And the region in which this dialect is
                    spoken
                    is referred as Magadha.
                    The ancient land of Magadha now roughly corresponds to the present districts of Patna and northern
                    half
                    of Gaya district.
                    Though the Magahi language extends to the other parts of Bihar such as Na landa, Aurangabad, Nawada,
                    Monghyr, Gir idih, Hazaribagh, Dhanbad, North-eastern Palamau, Northern Ranchi and the other parts
                    of
                    Bihar, the purest form of Magahi is preserved only in the districts of Patna and Gaya.
                    This may be referred as a ‘core region’ of the Magahi language.
                    Core region preserves not only the purity of dialect and cultural distinctiveness, it also helps in
                    the
                    determination of and sealing in the variation of the dialect or language. Magahi linguistically
                    bordered.
                </p>
                <h5>Bhojpuri</h5>
                <p>
                    Properly speaking Bhojpuri is the language of Bhojpur, “the name of town or pargana in the
                    North-West of
                    the district of Shahabad.”
                    In Bihar, the district in which it is spoken are Bhojpur, Rohtas, Chapra, Gopalganj, Siwan,
                    Champaran,
                    Motihari, Palamau, Ranchi, Hazaribagh, western portion of Vaishali and Muzaffarpur,20 besides in
                    some
                    parts of Santhal Pargana.
                    Bhojpuri language and culture have always been under the influence of West and Western forms of
                    speech
                    like Brajbhasa, Awadhi and Hindostani.
                    Further, the history of Bhojpuri language and literature is connected with the social and spiritual
                    movements that were launched in the 9th century by the Siddhas or various spiritual sects of that
                    time
                    in Bihar and Bengal.
                    The Sant Sahitya produced Bhakti literature and was written in Bhojpuri language.
                    This tradition continued upto 19th century. Except in this century, no conscious effort was ever
                    made to
                    cultivate this dialect.
                    It is a folk-language of the rural people who expressed lares and tales through this language.
                    In folk tales and songs, one comes across the sociocultural, religious and political aspects of
                    Bhojapuri life. Some of these songs are Sohar, Jhumar, Purbi, Janeo-geet, Bahura, Sitala, Ropani ke
                    geet, Parati, Bhajan, Nachari, Kajari etc.

                <h4>Historical work on Literature in Bihar</h4>
                <p>Bihar is one of the most densely populated states of India.
                    Bihar (erstwhile Magadh) has been the seat of Indian culture, education and power since ancient
                    times.
                    In the times of Mauryan Empire with Ashoka (269 BC to 232 BC), the great as its ruler where Nalanda
                    University was the major seat of all learning in ancient India.
                    Bihar has remained a land of culture, education, historical events, and birth place of many people
                    who
                    are admired globally even today.
                    It was here in Bodhgaya, that Prince Gautama attained supreme knowledge to become Buddha, the
                    enlightened one.
                    The great religion of Buddhism was born here, and Bodhgaya is one of the most important and sacred
                    Buddhist pilgrimage centers in the world.
                    Lord Mahavira (the founder of Jainism), Guru Gobind Singh (The tenth and the last guru of the
                    Sikhs),
                    Dr. Rajendra Prasad (1st President of India) and many more were born here.
                </p>
                <h4>Nalanda,</h4>
                <p>The world’s first seat of higher learning, a Monastic University which flourished from the 5th to the
                    11th century is in Bihar.
                    The University had 9 million books and 2000 teachers to impart knowledge to 10,000 students from all
                    over the Buddhist world.
                    Lord Buddha himself taught here and Hieun Tsang, the 7th century Chinese traveler, was a student
                    here.
                </p>
                <h4> Aryabhatta (476-550 A.D.)</h4>
                <p>He was born in Patliputra in Magadha, modern Patna in Bihar. His greatest contribution has to be
                    ZERO.
                    His other works include algebra, arithmetic, trigonometry, quadratic equations and the sine table.
                    He went as far as to explain the eclipse of the moon and the sun, day and night, the contours of the
                    earth, the length of the year exactly as 365 days.
                    He even computed the circumference of the earth as 24835 miles which is close to modern day
                    calculation
                    of 24900 miles.
                    At present Bihar stand Bihar today is an extension of its historic self amalgamating smoothly into
                    the
                    modern technological world.
                    Despite commercial pressures the state and its people have continued to pursue education and books
                    with
                    the same spirit.
                    Therefore, it’s only in Bihar that an organization like Super 30 works. Super 30 provides training
                    to 30
                    poor students, free of cost for IIT entrance exam every year (one of the toughest exams in the
                    world)
                    and they all qualify with a ranking in top 100 in all India out of 3.6 million students.
                </p>
