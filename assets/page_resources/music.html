                    Religiosity, season, migration, and rites the passage – birth, marriage, and death – are the themes
                    around which the music, dance, and amusements of the village folk of Bihar revolve. This is common
                    to
                    both men and women. Here religious entertainment takes the form of amusement for the masses.
                </p>
                <p>The region's folk songs are associated with the various events in the life of an ordinary person. The
                    historical ballads dealing with the heroic deeds of the freedom fighter Kunwar Singh have also been
                    immortalized through folk songs in the plain tracts of Bihar. Religiosity is the pivot around which
                    the music and amusements of the village folk of Bihar revolve. There are songs like sohar -
                    performed during childbirth, sumangali - associated with wedding, ropnigeet - performed during the
                    season of sowing paddy, katnigeet - performed during the paddy harvesting season, purbi, Fagua- Holi
                    festival song, Ghato-Chaita &amp; Chaiti is very popular in the month of Chait (Hindi calendar),
                    bidesia, birha, kajari, irni/ birni, pachra, jhumar, jatsari, aalah, nirgun and samdaun. There is
                    also the tradition of war songs called Beer Kunwar. There is a great tradition of folk songs started
                    by Bhikhari Thakur, an artist from the Bhojpur region.<br />
                    The influence of Bihari music in seen in regions such as Mauritius, South Africa and the Caribbean,
                    where a large number of Bihari indentured labourers were taken during the nineteenth century as well
                    as Pakistan and Bangladesh where many Bihari Muslims migrated to after the partition of India.
                </p>
                <p>Other wandering folk singers include the Kathaks, who travelled in groups and performed accompanied
                    by dholak, sarangi, tamburu and majira. Other musician classes included Roshan Chouki, Bhajaniya,
                    Kirtaniya, Pamaria and Bhakliya.
                </p>
                <p>Bihar, in the ancient times has been an important place for dance and music. In places like Vaishali
                    and Rajgir, in ancient Bihar, beautiful girls acted as Nagar Shobhinis or town ornaments
                    (courtesans). Lord Buddha himself accepted this fact and he himself received an invitation from
                    Amrapali, the chief courtesan of Vaishali. These girls were proficient in music and dancing and were
                    part of processions of religious and social nature. It appears that singing and dancing were the
                    chief amusements of that age.
                </p>
                <p>The regular history of Mithila music dates back from Nanyadeva (1097-1133), a great patron of music
                    and author of a treatise on this art. He developed the popular ragas on systematic lines. This
                    Mithila music was carried to Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, etc. Later during the Muslim period,
                    music and dance met with many set-backs as these were tabooed for them. But the famous saint of
                    Bihar, H.Sharif-ud-din Ahmed Manari was not averse to music, vocal or instrumental.
                </p>
                <p>Folk songs, folk dances and religious songs of the Vaishanavas were also popular in medieval period.
                </p>

                    <h2 class="display-3">Folk Ragas</h2>
                </div>
                <p>During the famous chhath parva of Bihar, there is much music and a lot of singing of folk songs, both
                    at home and on the river bank. The historical ballads dealing with the heroic deeds of the freedom
                    fighter Kunwar Singh have also been immortalized through folk songs in the plain tracts of Bihar.
                    The folk music of Bihar has survived all attacks of modernism. Some performers of Bihar's traditions
                    have achieved commercial success. For example, Sharda Sinha (b. 1953) sings Bihari language folk
                    songs in concerts throughout the world and has released many recordings. Maithil musicians, who seem
                    to have been more popular outside Bihar, enriched Nepalese music and carried the traditions of their
                    Folk songs. Some of the ragas, which may be claimed as special to Bihar, are 'Nachari', 'Phag',
                    'Chaita', 'Purbi',’lagani raag’etc.In the religious-type of dance the gods and goddesses are invoked
                    through dance accompanied by folk-songs and music.
                </p>
                <p>Religiosity is the pivot around which the music and amusements of the village folk of Bihar revolve.
                    This is common to both men and women. Here religious entertainment takes the form of amusement for
                    the masses. At the slightest pretext, “Satyanarayana Katha” is held in all seasons of the year and
                    some religious scriptures are read and devotional songs are sung. There are some religious songs in
                    praise of Satyanarayana who is a convenient deity that could be worshiped at any time.
                </p>
                <p>Reading of the Tulsidas Ramayana is another form of common religious entertainment which keeps the
                    village folk enthralled.
                </p>
                <p>Ramlila, Nautanki and the Bhikharia songs enthral thousands of men and women in the fairs and
                    gatherings. Ramlila is essentially religious and based on active presentation of the story of Rama
                    and Sita. Nautanki are social plays, where many social evils are caricatured and they have an
                    educative value. Bhikharia songs have a wide range of themes and usually they aim at social
                    inhibitions and drawbacks of the society.<br />
                    Festival songs mark another important category of folk-song. Navaratra is religious and ritualistic
                    to the core. People, especially women-folk, worship goddess Devi for nine days with proper rituals
                    and observe fast. During the festivals, music conferences are arranged. There are certain rural
                    centres where fine forms of music have been developed. Darbhanga, Panchgachia in Saharsa district,
                    Ara and Jhabua towns have developed prolifically the music of various forms. There used to be a
                    school of music where village girls and boys were being trained in playing of Mridanga.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the rich local Zamindar families in different parts used to hold regular music conferences
                    every year. This form of entertainment has become rare now. <br />
                    Pastoral songs express the thoughts, aspirations and sorrows of the villagers. Kuvar-Vijay folk
                    songs are historical while Sobhnaika is sung at the time of marriage. Folk songs are widely recited
                    and appreciated on religious and social occasions like Nagpanchami, Janmasthami, Teej, Chauk Chanda,
                    Anant, Chhath, karma etc.
                </p>
                <p>The marriage ceremony holds an important place among the ceremonies prescribed by both shastras and
                    folklore. This ceremony lasting for several days is equally important for folk-songs. For example,
                    some songs are called nehchu songs, sung on the nail-cutting ceremony of the bridegroom. Jyonar is
                    also a form of folk-song which is sung when the bride and the wedding party enjoy a feast. These
                    jyonar songs enumerate the things which are being served in the feast. Marriage songs can be said to
                    be of three categories. The first one is ritualistic and has an air of magical charm about it.
                    Various spirits are involved by a song and imagining that the spirits are coming in they are shut up
                    in the cap, which is pasted on the wall of a room, and which during these marriage days is called
                    ‘Kohbar’. There are other songs imploring the presence and protection of various divinities and
                    spirits.<br />
                    Purely seasonal songs are those which are sung during raining season, especially in the month of
                    Savan and Bhadon. A class of these songs is called malhar. These songs express the pleasure of
                    ladies when they enjoy ‘rimjhim’ or light showers. They insist in swinging (jhula) while singing
                    with their friends and relatives.
                </p>
                <p>A category of songs are those in which women are free to sing according to their own choice and
                    pleasure, expressing feelings and emotions for different occasions. As this is a very important
                    occasion in the family life, there are many glimpses of delicate family relationship and finer
                    sentiments.

            <h4><strong>BIDESIA DANCE</strong> </h4>
            <p>
                Bidesia Dance deals with the many social problems prevailing in the society. It is believed that the
                creator of the dance Bhikari Thakur, who was a barber by profession, used funny and sarcastic
                comments to bring forth the serious issue and still not hurt the feelings of the people. The stories
                portrayed are so touching and realistic that they bring back the memories of yesteryears when men
                were taken away as slaves in distant lands and when used to feel in the pain of separation. They are
                also used to spread awareness among the masses about poverty, poor status of women in the society.
                Bidesia is performed in theater style with rhythmic language, soothing songs, and attractive music
                that makes it the most famous dance of Bihar.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>JHIJHIAN DANCE</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Jhijhian dance is a ritualistic dance that is performed during times when there is absolutely no
                rain and the land is sun parched. The motive of the dance is to lenify the God of rain, Lord Indra
                and ask for his favor in the form of rains. The dance is accompanied by a song which is full of
                prayers to Lord Indra. The participants of the dance include a lead singer, harmonium player, a
                bansuri player and a dholak player. The dance is only performed by women.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>KAJARI DANCE</strong></h4>
            <p>
                After the time of Jhijhian dance is over and its motive is successful, it is time for Kajari Dance.
                The dance is performed along with Kajari song which is a monsoon song . Starting in the Indian month
                of 'Shravan' which is the start of monsoon season, the dance is performed till the time rainy season
                persists. The songs describe the sudden and pleasant change in the nature that has happened and also
                account the refreshing and relaxing feeling that people of the village feel.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>PAIKA DANCE</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Paika dance is a form of martial arts dance that is performed in in the tribal area of Mayurbhanj.
                The dance is performed with shields and swords that with dancers displaying their ability to control
                these weapons. Paika name is coined using the Sanskrit word 'Padatika' which means infantry. The
                dance is performed only during special occasions. For this dance, the grounds are prepared with soft
                earth pattered with oil and water. Men, wearing colorful turbans and tight dhotis come to the
                grounds to perform as warriors. They stand in two rows and enact a scene of fierce combat. Earlier
                the specially made grounds were called Paika akhadas which were the village gymnasium where people
                used to come in the evening. Some people still like to call it that.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>SOHAR-KHILOUNA DANCE</strong></h4>
            <p>
                The foremost event in one’s life is his birth. The birth of a child is celebrated all over the country
                with different traditional rituals. In Bihar, ladies always sings Sohar on the occasion of birth
                ceremony of a child. They sometimes compare the child with Lord Rama, sometimes with Lord Krishana and
                so on. Sohar has its own distinctive dictions. The ladies bless the baby while singing and acting the
                tender words of Sohar like “Machia baithal sasu puchelli …”

            <h4><strong>HOLI DANCE</strong></h4>
            Holi is a well known festival to the whole nation. We all know that the first day of the Hindu Calendar,
            that is, “Pratham Chairtra Mass” is the day of “Holi”. A colourful festival which conveys the massage for
            religious integration apart from any sort of bigotism. There is a typical style “Dhamar” of holi singing in
            our villages in which the villagers celebrate it in a form of group with full joy and dances with musical
            instruments like dholak, jhal-manjeera, etc. </p>
            <h4><strong>JHUMARI DANCE</strong></h4>
            Jumari Dance of Bihar is similar to “Garva of Gujrat”. Specialized to the married women, it is a folk dance
            of Mithilanchal of Bihar. After the month of Ashwin (September-October) comes Kartik. The sky is crystal
            clear, there is no cloud, it is full moon spreading milky rays all over. Maids in love go on dancing,
            singing and celebrating the turns of the season. The amusing words of jumeri are – “Kartik Mas na Aakashey
            Badari ...”</p>
            <h4><strong>HARVESTING DANCE</strong></h4>
            Bihar is an agriculture-based State. In the harvesting season, male and female villagers do their work with
            dance and song in the field. Their happiness and joy is the symbol of good crop. The popular melodious tune
            of the harvesting song is “Chal Dhani Khetwa mei gaye…”</p>
