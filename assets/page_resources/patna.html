                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Patna</strong> stretches along the southern bank of
                the Ganges for about 15 km. The 5.7 km - long Mahatma Gandhi Setu, one of the longest river bridges in
                the world, connects Patna with northern Bihar.
            </h5>
            <h5>Patna, located just east of the river’s confluence with three major tributaries, was once a powerful
                city. Early in the 5th century BC, Ajatasatru shifted the capital of his Magadha kingdom from Rajgir to
                Pataliputra (Patna), fulfilling Buddha’s prophecy that a great city would arise here.
                EmperorsChandragupta Maurya and Ashoka also called Pataliputra home, and it remained one of India’s most
                important cities for almost 1000 years </h5>

                <p>It is Patna’s latest iconic 34m-high sandstone arch - <em>Sabhyata Dwar </em>- on the bank of river
                    Ganga, built with a Mauryan architecture to evoke the glory of the ancient capital of Pataliputra
                    that serves as the ceremonial gateway to the city. It stands on the sprawling premises of the Samrat
                    Ashoka International Convention Centre, which neighbours the Patna’s Gandhi Maidan.
                </p>
                <p>The ceremonial arch was originally envisioned by late ex-Vice Army Chief Lt Gen (retd) S K Sinha as
                    the ‘civilisation gate’ that would beckon travellers and passersby to Patna and draw them to its
                    rich and multi-layered history, as it did in the reign of the Mauryan Empire over 2,500 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>The inscriptions will be attributed to Megasthenes, the ancient Greek envoy to Pataliputra – the

                    his son Khuda Bakhsh, who inherited 1,400 manuscripts and continued to add to the collection and
                    eventually converted it into a private library by 1880. The library was opened to public upon its
                    inauguration by Sir Charles Alfred Elliott, Governor of Bengal on 5 October 1891. After partition in
                    1947, Dr. S.V. Sohoni played a key role in ensuring that the collections were retained in India.[5]
                    In 1969 through a Federal Legislation, an Act of Parliament, namely 'Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public
                    Library Act' (1969), the Government of India declared Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library a centre

                    library. Today it continues to attract scholars from all over the world.

                    Years after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, an appeal was made to the citizens of India
                    nationwide to build memorials for Gandhi. With the help of contributions of poor and rich citizens
                    of India, a trust was established with the name Mahatma Gandhi National Memorial Trust, for this
                    cause.[3][4] The Patna Sangrahalaya was established in 1967[5] near the North-Western corner of
                    Gandhi Maidan. It was a member of the Central Gandhi Sangrahalaya Samiti until July 1971, when the
                    five museums (Ahmadabad, Madurai, Bairakpore, Mumbai, Patna) were made independent.

                    Built in the Stupa architecture, the building has a height of 29 m. It is pillar-less with a wall of
                    thickness of 3.6 m at the base. One can climb at the top of the Golghar through the 145 steps of its
                    spiral stairway around it. The spiral staircase was designed to facilitate the passage of the

                    deliver their load through a hole at the top, and descend the other stairs.

                    Patan Devi, also called Maa Patneshwari is the oldest and one of the most sacred temples of Patna.
                    It is regarded as one of the 51 Siddha Shakti Pithas in India. According to Puranic legends, the
                    'right thigh' of the corpse of Sati had fallen here when it was chopped off by Lord Vishnu with his
                    'Sudarshan Chakra'. The ancient temple, originally called Maa Sarvanand Kari Patneshwari, is
                    believed to be the abode of the goddess Durga. The name of the city Patna is widely believed to have
                    been derived from the name of the Bari Patan Devi Temple (located nearby Patna Saheb Gurudwara).
                    Some, however, doubt whether the name of Patna is derived from this temple. According to them, the
                    name is derived from Patan, which means a town and Patna was a big place of export and import.

                    The temple is widely revered for its belief in curing smallpox and chicken pox. Another popular
                    legend states that this was the well where Ashoka threw 99 of his elder half-brother's heads and put
                    the heads in the well to obtain the throne of the Mauryan Empire.
