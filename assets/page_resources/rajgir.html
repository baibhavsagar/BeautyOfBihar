                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Rajgir</strong> just 15 kms from Nalanda is located the complex of
                temples and monasteries.
                The place is called Rajgir. It is one of the most important tourist places in India.
                Being located in a valley, Rajgir is a very scenic place. The small hill grit town
                is covered with lush green forest which add to the beauty of the place. Rajgir was
                the capital of the Magadh Mahajanpad (State) when Patliputra was not formed. In
                those days it was called Rajgrih. Rajgir or Rajgrih means the home of Royalty. This
                place has been associated with Lord Buddha and Buddhism. Buddha not only spent many
                years in Rajgir but also delivered sermons here and proselytized emperor Bimbisar
                at the Griddhakoota hill. The Jivekarmavan monastery was the favorite residence
                for Buddha. Even Bimbisar gave Venuvan Vihar to Buddha for his residence. It is
                said that it was at Rajgir that physician treated Buddha, Jivak after he was injured
                by his cousin Devdatta.The teachings of Buddha was penned down at Rajgir and it
                was also the venue for the first Buddhist Council. Today Rajgir has come up as one
                of the most important pilgrimage for the Buddhist.Rajgir also has some very beautiful
                Hindu and Jain temples which attracts Hindus and Jains also to the place. Not only
                as a place for worship, Rajgir has come up as health and winter resort with its
                warm water ponds. These ponds are said to contain some medicinal properties which
                help in the cure of many skin diseases. The added attraction of Rajgir is the Ropeway
                which takes you uphill to the Shanti Stupa and Monasteries built by the Japanese
                Devotees on top of the Ratnagiri hills.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Seven years after he attained Buddhahood, Siddhartha fulfilled his promise to KngBimbisara by
                        returning to Rajagaha to teach the Dhamma. When the Buddha arrived in the city, accompanied by
                        the highest accomplished three Kassapa brothers and their 1000 fire-worshippers turned bhikkus,
                        the townsmen were astounded. Hearing about the large group of noble mendicants, King Bimbisara
                        came rushing to the Palm Grove with a group of Brahmins.<br />
                        The King was unsure – seeing the large congregation of solemn meditators – whether the Buddha
                        was the leader or the famous UruvelaKashyap. Sensing their confusion, UruvelaKassap prostrated
                        at the Buddha’s feet and acknowledged him as leader. Highly impressed at the elder’s act of
                        reverence, King Bimbisara requested the Buddha to give them a teaching. The Buddha was glad to
                        see his old friend and he taught  the King and his ministers the teachings on benefits of
                        charity, ethics as a foundation for liberation, the harm of over indulgence in sensual
                        pleasures, futility of conceit, bliss of renunciation, and the Four Noble Truths. </p>

                    <p>Highly pleased and elated by the talk, the King invited the entire Sangha to the royal courtyard
                        for the next day’s meal. The king also offered his pleasure park, the 100 acres Bamboo Grove
                        (Veluvana), to the Sangha. The Buddha accepted the donation.This pleasure park, with its lotus
                        pond, pavallions, flower gardens, waling paths, and clusters of bamboo trees, is the site of
                        Sangha’s first monastery.From that point onwards, bhikkus were allowed to dwell in permanent
                        monasteries.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese pilgrim, XuanZang spent two years staying in the monastery who referred this site as
                        YastivanaVihara. He explained that the name of the site was derived from the time a man, who
                        measured the Buddha’s height with a stick (lathi) made from the palmwood, and threw it on the
                        ground. The stick took root and eventually spread, thus becoming Lathivana or Yasthivana.<br />
                        In front of the water reservoir or lotus pond in Veluvana, there is a shrine with a black Buddha
                        statue. The location was perfect for the Buddha’s Order, neither too far from the town, nor too
                        near, accessible , yet serene. At the Bamboo Grove, the Buddha spent his second, third, and
                        fourth rainy seasons after his enlightenment. Its congenial grounds became the sceme for many
                        discourses. There are several areas of the parks, mentioned in the Pali canon, such as
                        Squirrel’s Feeding Place, The Peackock Feeding Place, and the lotus pond. The only identifiable
                        place today is the lotus pond.</p>

                    <p>To reach this location on the Vaibhara Hill, one has to take a stone path beyond Lakshmi Narain
                        temple near Rajgir’s famous sulphur hot spring.  The Buddha stayed in this cave a few times, but
                        it is celebrated for bbeing the venue of the First Council (PatthamaDhamma-Sangti) after the
                        Buddha’s death.</p>
                    <p>The elder Mahakassapa foresaw the necessity of organizing the Buddha’s teaching and community in
                        order to prevent erosion of the Buddha’s work. Three months after Bddha’s passing, Mahakassapa
                        summoned 500 senior awakened bhikkus to compile and authenticate the Buddha’s teaching, which
                        would be handed over for posterity.King Ajatsatru sponsored the seven month long event and
                        during the council, the recently awakened Ananda, gifted with extraordinary memory, recited the
                        Sutta and abhidhammaPitakas. The recitatation included the Buddha’s actual discourses, where
                        they were given and on whose account. Mahakassapa appointed Upali, an authority on monastic
                        discipline (vinaya), to recite the code of conduct, as well as the circumstances that caused
                        these rules to be formulated. When both Ananda and Upali had finished their recitations, the
                        entire assembly repeated them together to show their unanimous acceptance. From that time
                        onwards, the Buddha’s teachings were preserved in this fashion until the Fourth Council held in
                        Sri Lanka in 29 BCE, when they were written on palm leaves.<br />
                        From the bird’s eye view atop the hill, the paddy fields below are reminiscent of the time when
                        the Buddha suggested to Ananda that the bhikkus’ robes should be cut and sewn in a similar
                        pattern, symbolizing bhikkus as a fertile land in which seeds of merit and virtue are sown to
                        benefit the present and future generations. The symbolic tradition is still kept today.</p>

                    <p>There are two ways to reach to the peak. The first option is to walk for 20 minutes beyond the
                        stalls up the stairway, and then make a right at the fork in the path. According to XuanZang,
                        the first cave on your right is said to be the where Ananda attained enlightenment before the
                        First Council. The second cave on your right is said to be Boar’s Grotto, where Sariputta became
                        an arahant. At the end of the main path you come across a stairway that leads to the top of the
                        mountain containing ancient ruins and a contemporary shrine.</p>
                    <p>The Buddha shuttled between the Bamboo Grove and this crag, whose natural silence made it an
                        ideal place for serious meditation. Many of the Buddha’s students, including Sariptta and
                        Ananda, became arahants in one of the caves in this rocky hill. According to a fable,  disturbed
                        by a wicked vulture’s pecking the shaved head of the monks while they were meditating, the
                        Buddha froze the vulture into a boulder and that’s how its called the Vulture Peak. </p>
